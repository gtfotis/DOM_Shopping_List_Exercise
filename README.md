# Dynamically Create a Shopping List

* Using the existing form, your goal is to generate a shopping list.
* Dynamically generate the list by appending `li` elements to the `#myList` element


## Steps to create the list

* User fills out the form
* User clicks the "Make My List" button
* Items from the form populate the list

### Hints

* This would be a good use case for using `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`
* Think about using a `forEach()` loop on the `input` elements
* You'll want to add an event listener for the button element
* Think about using a function to generate the list (perhaps the button click could call this function??  ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”)
